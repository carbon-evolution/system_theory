# Ecosystem Simulation: A System Theory Approach

An interactive simulation demonstrating complex system dynamics through a three-level ecosystem model. This project illustrates fundamental concepts of system theory using predator-prey relationships, which can be applied to various domains including business competition and market dynamics.

## System Theory Concepts

System theory studies how different parts of a system interact and influence each other over time. This simulation demonstrates key concepts:

1. **Dynamic Equilibrium**: Systems tend to find balance points where opposing forces stabilize
2. **Feedback Loops**: Actions of one component affect others, which in turn affect the first
3. **Nonlinear Behavior**: Small changes can lead to large effects over time
4. **Emergence**: Complex patterns arise from simple rules
5. **Carrying Capacity**: Natural limits in any system

## Simulation Components

### Population Dynamics
- **Prey (Green)**: Represents base resources or market opportunities
- **Predators (Red)**: Primary competitors or established businesses
- **Apex Predators (Blue)**: Market leaders or disruptive forces

### Visualization Modes

1. **Time Series Plot** (Main Graph):
   - Shows population changes over time
   - Reveals cyclical patterns and system stability
   - Demonstrates carrying capacity effects

2. **Phase Space Plot** (Right Graph):
   - Plots predator vs. prey populations
   - Spiral patterns indicate stable cycles
   - Chaotic patterns suggest market turbulence

3. **Spatial Distribution** (When Enabled):
   - Shows geographic/market segment distribution
   - Demonstrates diffusion of competition
   - Visualizes territory/market share dynamics

### Interactive Controls

#### Population Parameters
- **Prey Birth Rate**: Growth rate of opportunities/resources
- **Predation Rate**: Competition effectiveness
- **Predator Growth**: Success rate in utilizing resources
- **Predator Death**: Natural market exit rate
- **Apex Predation**: Impact of market leaders
- **Apex Growth**: Market leader expansion rate
- **Apex Death**: Market leader decline rate

#### Environmental Parameters
- **Carrying Capacity**: Market size/resource limits
- **Seasonal Effect**: Periodic market fluctuations
- **Diffusion Rate**: Speed of market spread

## Business Applications

### Market Competition Analysis
This simulation can model competitive market dynamics:
- Prey → Market opportunities/customer base
- Predators → Competing businesses
- Apex Predators → Market leaders/innovators

### Examples:
1. **Retail Market**:
   - Prey: Consumer spending potential
   - Predators: Local retailers
   - Apex: Large chain stores

2. **Technology Sector**:
   - Prey: User base/market demand
   - Predators: Startups/smaller companies
   - Apex: Tech giants

### Using for Market Prediction

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Identify cyclic market behavior
   - Predict potential market saturation
   - Anticipate competitive responses

2. **Strategy Testing**:
   - Adjust parameters to test different scenarios
   - Evaluate market entry timing
   - Assess competition intensity effects

3. **Risk Assessment**:
