# Ecosystem Simulation

An interactive simulation of a three-level ecosystem dynamics featuring prey (rabbits), predators (foxes), and apex predators (wolves). This project demonstrates complex ecological interactions, population dynamics, and spatial distribution patterns in a predator-prey system.

## Features

- **Population Dynamics**: Simulates the interaction between three trophic levels
- **Interactive Controls**: Real-time adjustment of system parameters
- **Spatial Distribution**: Optional spatial mode showing species distribution
- **Phase Space Analysis**: Visualizes the relationship between population levels
- **Seasonal Effects**: Incorporates seasonal variations in population dynamics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecosystem-simulation.git
cd ecosystem-simulation
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the simulation:
```bash
python "python programs/system theory/system_theory.py"
```

### Controls

- **Sliders**: Adjust various system parameters in real-time
- **Spatial Mode**: Toggle between standard and spatial visualization
- **Play/Stop**: Control spatial distribution animation
- **Reset**: Return to initial conditions
